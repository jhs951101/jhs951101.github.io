				<strong class="title2">Things to Contribute to Society</strong><br>
				Since you can see at a glance how many seats are filled in the cafes around you, you can easily decide which cafe to go to for a break and avoid wandering around as much as possible. It is estimated that it will be useful not only in cafes, but also in restaurants, banks, and community centers.

				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				I visited the cafe to take a break, but the place was already full, so I had to find another cafe. It's also cumbersome to call the cafe and ask if it's full every time. So, to solve this problem, we implemented a program to check the number of people in a cafe using Python OpenCV.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to use OpenCV in Python.</li>
						<li>I learned how to link Java programs and Python programs.</li>
						<li>I learned how to use the asynchronous method with Multi-Thread in Java and the structure of Multi-Threading.</li>
						<li>I learned how to implement a client with Java Swing.</li>
						<li>I learned how to embed Google Maps in Android.</li>
						<li>I learned how to implement a client in Android.</li>
						<li>I learned how to build a server with Java, build a database with MySQL, and connect with JDBC.</li>
					</ul>

				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I made a cafe-only program based on Java Swing and a user-only program based on the Android app. At this time, I put Google Maps on the app screen.</li>
						<li>I built a server with Java, and the database was built with MySQL and then linked with JDBC. However, there was no response when the cafe program delivered information. So, as a result of searching on Google, I made the cafe program to inherit Thread in order to exchange information with the server, but I found out that in order for a multi-thread to share a variable value right away, I need to use volatile for the variable. I was able to solve the problem by using volatile.</li>
						<li>I linked the Python program with the Cafe program and then make the Python program count the population by face recognition, which was the most difficult.</li>
						<li>So, I found an example of face recognition using OpenCV on Google and modified it to count the population after analyzing the source code.</li>
						<li>And, I referred the source code to link the Python program with the cafe program after finding an example of running a Python program in a Java program on Google.</li>
						<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
