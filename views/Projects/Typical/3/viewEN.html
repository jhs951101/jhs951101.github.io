				<strong class="title2">Things to Contribute to Society</strong><br>
				You can also grow crops in the metaverse environment, so you don't have to go to the place where you grow your crops. It is also possible for the computer to manage the crops by itself through an artificial intelligence program.

				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				The metaverse environment has not yet been established in Korea much. Most representatively, there is currently no service to grow crops in the metaverse environment in Korea. So, we have implemented a program that can grow crops in the metaverse environment.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to send HTTP Requests in Unity.</li>
						<li>I learned how to implement a payment function with the NH Open Platform by sending an HTTP Request.</li>
						<li>I learned how to fetch public data from a public data portal by sending an HTTP Request.</li>
						<li>I learned how to use Agora for audio and video communication in Unity.</li>
						<li>I learned how to build a server with PUN2 and how to build a database with Firebase.</li>
						<li>I learned how to build a metaverse environment with Unity.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I downloaded an example of voice communication using Agora.</li>
						<li>I built a server with PUN2 and built a database with Firebase.</li>
						<li>I implemented a payment function with the NH open platform and had the weather data loaded from a public data portal, but this was the most difficult.</li>
						<li>So, I applied the example of sending HTTP Request from Google to my program and linked Unity with the NH Open Platform.</li>
						<li>And, I modified the source code to load weather data from a public data portal after rewatching and following the lecture given by the hosting company.</li>
						<li>I carefully observed contents which designers designed in Zeplin and implemented it directly in Unity.</li>
						<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
						<li>I uploaded a demonstration video to Google Drive after filming it, and sent it to the planner.</li>
					</ol>
