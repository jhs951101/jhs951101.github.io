				<strong class="title2">Things to Contribute to Society</strong><br>
				As you get more information by getting a little tip in your daily life, you can reduce the hassle of searching for the information you need every time, and lead a more rewarding life.
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				It happens that you miss out on important benefits to yourself and regret later. Also, it is too cumbersome to search for content that is important to you every time. So, to solve this problem as much as possible, I implemented a tip recommendation program using the R recommendation library.
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to implement a recommendation algorithm with recommenderlab in R, and the difference between user collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering.</li>
						<li>I learned how to link Java programs and R programs.</li>
						<li>I learned how to send mail using SMTP as Transport in Java and the difference between SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.</li>
						<li>I learned how to build a web server with Java and Servlet, and how to build a database with MySQL and connect with JDBC.</li>
						<li>I learned how to send HTTP requests from a web page and the difference between GET and POST.</li>
						<li>I learned how to implement web pages with JSP, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I implemented an example recommendation based on evaluation information in the book 'Recommendation system using R' and implemented it as a recommendation algorithm with recommenderlab.</li>
						<li>I built a web page and a web server with JSP and Servlet, and built a database with MySQL and linked it with JDBC.</li>
						<li>I had Tip search results displayed at a time.</li>
						<li>I linked the R program with the web server and then sent the email from the web server, which was the most difficult.</li>
						<li>So, I referred the source code to link the R program to the web server after finding an example of running an R program in a Java program on Google.</li>
						<li>And I searched Google for an example of sending an email using Transport and SMTP in a Java program and analyzed the source code so that the email was sent from the web server.</li>
						<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
