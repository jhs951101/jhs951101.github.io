				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				There was an assignment to create a program for Cortex-M3 in a microprocessor application design class. It was created to make the most creative work possible.
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to implement Cortex-M3 dedicated programs in C.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>At first, I didn't know anything, so I implemented and executed simple things one by one, such as moving a character or shooting a laser gun. The interrupt method is used to operate when the button is pressed like this.</li>
<li>I put together the implementations so far and ran it, but it didn't work.</li>
<li>I checked the source code closely and made some modifications to make it work.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
