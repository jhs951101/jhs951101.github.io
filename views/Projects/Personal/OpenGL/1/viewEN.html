				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				I had a task to make a ball bouncing game using OpenGL in my computer graphics class.
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to create objects in OpenGL by moving and rotating the coordinate system.</li>
<li>I learned how to detect keyboard input in OpenGL.</li>
<li>I learned how to use OpenGL in C</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I ran the OpenGL example program that the professor gave me as a hint.</li>
<li>There were a lot of things I didn't know, such as how to create an object by moving the coordinate system and how to control an object with the arrow keys. So, I looked it up on Google. I implemented it and then executed it based on the contents of the investigation, but the program was abruptly terminated.</li>
<li>After finding it on Google and modifying the source code, I was able to make it run as intended and implemented a ball bouncing game.</li>
<li>It's a bit difficult to keep objects in 2D state, so I searched Google for a way to turn 2D objects into 3D and turned 2D objects into 3D.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
					</ol>
