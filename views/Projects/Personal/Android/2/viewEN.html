				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				People use smartphones a lot these days, so I made my own game to make creative smartphone games to provide services to people, and to prepare for becoming a game developer.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to draw graphics with View and Canvas on Android.</li>
<li>You know how to build an Android app.</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I ran an example of drawing graphics with View and Canvas in the ‘Android Programming’ book.</li>
<li>However, there were many things I didn't know, such as how to display an image graphically, how to make a touch sense, and so on, so I searched for a long time on Google.</li>
<li>I found several functions that deal with graphics after searching for a long time, and I combined these functions into a single game.</li>
<li>I had a button clicked to move to the game screen.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
<li>I decided to make it again with Unity after studying Unity after a few days. This is because game engines are mainly used for game production in business. The process was the same for Unity.</li>
