				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				People use smartphones a lot these days, so I made my own game to make creative smartphone games to provide services to people, and to prepare for becoming a game developer.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to draw graphics with View and Canvas on Android.</li>
<li>I learned how to build an Android app.</li>

			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I could quickly come up with a solution to the problem, and I had this program use the method of drawing graphics with View and Canvas before making the game.</li>
<li>The clicker game took longer than I thought because it was the first time I made it. The process of making the game itself was the most difficult. So there were a lot of errors, such as not responding when touched and zombies not dying.</li>
<li>I modified source codes and then executed them continuously in order to solve these errors.</li>
<li>If this doesn't work, I searched for an error message on Google, researched a solution to the problem, and applied it to my program.</li>
<li>However, when I fixed one error, another error popped up, and I did a lot of searching on Google to solve it.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
