				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				There was once an intra-school Scratch competition in high school. In order to provide services to people by making creative games, and to prepare for becoming a game developer, I created and submitted my own game.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to implement a game with Scratch.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I borrowed a Scratch book from the library and selected and executed only the necessary examples.</li>
<li>Referring to the examples in the Scratch book, I implemented necessary things little by little, such as clicking and suppressing zombies, decreasing life when zombies approach a wall, and raising the skill gauge little by little. Actually, it was my first time making a game with pure programming, so I was very worried.</li>
<li>I modified the code after combining the implementations so far.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
