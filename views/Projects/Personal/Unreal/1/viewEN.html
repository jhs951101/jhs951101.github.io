				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				Unreal is the second most used engine for game development these days after Unity. To this extent, Unreal has become a basic knowledge for game developers. Therefore, in preparation for becoming a game developer, I have created my own game to develop basic knowledge.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to implement programs in Blueprints in Unreal, and the pros and cons of Blueprints and C++.</li>
<li>I learned how to implement events in Blueprints and then call them.</li>
<li>I learned how to change the property values of a Color Object with Blueprints.</li>
					</ul>

				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I followed the 'Unreal Engine 4 for Beginners' lectures one by one.</li>
<li>I implemented several functions after building the game environment. The most typical example is to open the door by stepping on the 4 footrests in order.</li>
<li>This is called after implementing the event in Blueprint. And I changed the Color value of the Color Object to change the color of the footrest when stepping on the footrest.</li>
<li>However, it didn't work as I intended. So, I was able to open the door by stepping on the steps in order, after revisiting what I followed in the lecture, finding and fixing the problem.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
