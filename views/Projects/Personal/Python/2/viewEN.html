				<strong class="title2">Things to Contribute to Society</strong><br>
				When a confirmed case of COVID-19 occurs, it can only be recorded as a record without notification, so you can get information on the occurrence of confirmed cases without being disturbed by notifications.
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				The existing COVID-19 emergency message is sent immediately when a confirmed person occurs, so there is a problem in that it is interrupted by a notification sounding at any time. However, if the emergency message is blocked, there is a problem that the information about the number of confirmed cases cannot be recorded. So, we implemented a chatbot so that you can get information about the number of confirmed cases without notification.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to control a Telegram chatbot with a Python program.</li>
<li>I learned how to crawl with BeautifulSoup in Python.</li>
<li>I learned how to split a string with the split() function in Python.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I downloaded the source code for ‘Make your own LAN girlfriend with chatbot’. Here, the source code used a library called 'telegram.ext'.</li>
<li>I found an example of web crawling on Google and executed it. Here, the example uses BeautifulSoup.</li>
<li>On the website of Gimpo City Hall, only the articles of confirmed cases appeared, and then clicked 'View Source' to closely analyze the web page code. After that, I used the split() function to get only the title, content, and link of the post.</li>
<li>I created a new chatbot as shown on YouTube, and combined it with the web crawling example to notify after crawling.</li>
<li>I need to know if there are new posts with confirmed cases. This is done by storing the titles of recent posts in a text file and comparing them periodically. A new one is created if the text file does not exist.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
