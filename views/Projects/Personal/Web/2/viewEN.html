				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				Every company these days has a website. Recently, homepages are mainly made with React. To this extent, React became the basic knowledge for web developers. Therefore, in preparation for becoming a web developer, I have implemented my own website to develop basic knowledge.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to send HTTP requests from a web page and the difference between GET and POST.</li>
<li>I learned how to use JSON Arrays in React.</li>
<li>I learned how to build a database with MongoDB and how to interface with React server.</li>
					</ul>

				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I created and ran a new project after installing React, but it failed with the error message below.<br>
command failed with exit code 1</li>
<li>After a long investigation, I found that the MacBook with the M1 chip requires Node v.15 or higher to run without errors. So, I ran it again, and it worked properly, after I installed v.16, the most recent version</li>
<li>I implemented the login & logout homepage by following John Ahn's 'Basic Node React lecture' one by one. Here, I decided to create a top bar on the homepage and add post upload and search functions.</li>
<li>Uploading a post requires a little modification of the member registration function, but the post search function requires fetching multiple data from the database. However, I didn't know how to implement it in React, so I googled it and found that I have to use the find() function.</li>
<li>At first, nothing came out. The data itself is not passed. When I looked at the login function, I found that I had to pass it in the form of a JSON array when passing data.</li>
<li>It received the data normally and printed the list of posts when I converted it into JSON array and sent it.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
