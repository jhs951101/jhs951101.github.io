				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				These days, I use Unity a lot for developing smartphone games. To this extent, Unity has become a basic knowledge for mobile game developers. Also, these days, games are all online. So, in preparation for becoming a game developer, I have created my own online game to develop basic knowledge.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to handle Collision in Unity and the difference between Collision and Trigger.</li>
<li>I learned how to build a server with PUN2 and how to build a database with Firebase.</li>
					</ul>

				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I followed retr0's lecture on ‘Making a Unity multiplayer network game in one shot’ lecture.</li>
<li>I also listened to Gold Metal's lecture on ‘2D vertical scrolling shooting’ until the 2nd lecture. After that, I decided to make my own 'online shooting game'.</li>
<li>First, I implemented a function of controlling the airplane and firing the bullet as taught in the lecture. When the left and right buttons are pressed, I had the airplane rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, and the health gauge reduced further when the bullet is hit.</li>
<li>I built a server with PUN2 and built a database with Firebase. However, when I ran the program after interlocking, the following error message appeared when the bullet hit the wall.<br>
Failed to 'network-remove' GameObject.</li>
<li>As a result of searching on Google, I had a clone created for each player's space when an object (GameObject) is created on the network. And, I had the clone move in the same way when the object moves. Here, there is a rule that only the player who created the object can remove it when removing an object. An error occurred because the deletion process was executed recklessly without following this.</li>
<li>So, the error message went away when I modified the player who created the object to delete the object.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
