				People use smartphones a lot these days, so I made my own game to make creative smartphone games to provide services to people, and to prepare for becoming a game developer.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to handle Collision in Unity and the difference between Collision and Trigger.</li>
<li>I learned how to start and stop periodic processing with Coroutine and IEnumerator in Unity.</li>

				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I created a Unity 3D project and implemented the land and roads.</li>
<li>Enemies move along the path when they appears. I implemented this by placing a Collider in the middle of the road and changing the destination whenever a collision occurs.</li>
<li>I implemented the UI to create a new turret and upgrade attack power.</li>
<li>I had a new turret created when you touch the location to create it. Similarly, I had the turret moved when you touch the turret and touch a new position to move it.</li>
<li>I had turrets attack enemies if they comes within range of the turret.</li>
<li>I had enemies appear after leveling up every 60 seconds.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
