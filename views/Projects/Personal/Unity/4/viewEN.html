				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I implemented the client with Unity. At this time, HTTP Request was sent.</li>
						<li>I built a server with PHP, built a database with MariaDB, and then linked.</li>
						<li>I launched a server on AWS and Cafe24. However, when it was launched on AWS, an error occurred that could not even access the database. So, after creating a new MariaDB user, I gave this user all privileges and used it on the server. This is how I made it possible to access the database.</li>
						<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
