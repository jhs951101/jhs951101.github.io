				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				Nowadays, people use mobile apps a lot. Therefore, I implemented my own app to develop basic knowledge in preparation for becoming an iOS app developer.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to center a layout with constraints and how to place objects at the bottom.</li>
						<li>I learned how to use the Stack View</li>
						<li>I learned how to call an event when a button is touched.</li>
						<li>I learned how to use objects in the layout, such as input fields and labels, in Swift.</li>
						<li>I learned how to decorate the UI, such as resizing the layout and changing the color of the buttons.</li>

				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
<li>I followed the ‘iOS Tutorial (2020) How To Make Your First App’ lecture one by one.</li>
<li>I realized that the Vertical Stack View cannot be arbitrarily adjusted horizontally while implementing my own program. So I centered the View with constraints and adjusted the horizontal length.</li>
<li>I renamed objects in the layout and reconnected to Swift. At this time, I pressed the Command key and dragged with the mouse to connect. And when you click the button, you can see the discounted price.</li>
<li>I decorated the UI by changing the color of the text in the input field and changing the color of the button. And changed the app name and icon.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
