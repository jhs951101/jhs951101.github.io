				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to use the asynchronous method with Multi-Thread in Java and the structure of Multi-Threading.</li>
<li>I learned how to convert an image to bytes and store it in an array.</li>
<li>I learned how to implement a client with Java Swing.</li>
<li>I learned how to build and run a server on AWS.</li>
<li>I learned how to handle Hangul strings in Python.</li>
<li>I learned how to build a server with Python</li>

				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>I ran a TCP/IP programming example from the 'Basic of Java' book.</li>
<li>I found 'Example of a chat program using TCP socket' in Google, analyzed the source code, and learned how to implement it. Here, in the example, the asynchronous method was used with Multi Thread.</li>
<li>I modified the example and implemented it as it is.</li>
<li>I didn't know how to extract consonants from Korean words, so I searched on Google.</li>
<li>I also added a function to send an image to give hints. This was done by converting the image into a byte array and sending it.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
