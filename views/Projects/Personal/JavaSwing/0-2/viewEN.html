				I create and release creative games, so you can experience a different kind of fun while playing the game.

				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				In order to provide services to people by making creative games, I decided to create my own game to prepare myself for becoming a game developer.

				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I have learned how to implement computer programs with Java Swing.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>A professor provided a program for cutting images with multiple buttons during the ‘Object-Oriented Programming’ class in the 2nd semester of your sophomore year. After arbitrarily arranging buttons in a two-dimensional array, we have modified them so that they are swapped when clicking two buttons.</li>
<li>I added a hint button on the top menu bar to show the original image when clicked.</li>
<li>I implemented a function to select one of several pictures before starting the game and a function to load the desired picture.</li>
<li>When loading a desired picture, an error occurs when loading a picture that is too large. So, I added a function to adjust the size when loading an image.</li>
<li>Finally, I implemented the game start screen.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
