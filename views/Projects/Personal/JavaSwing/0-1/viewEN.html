				I created and released creative games, so you can experience a different kind of fun while playing the game.

				<strong class="title1">Background and Purpose</strong><br>
				In order to provide services to people by making creative games, I decided to create my own game to prepare myself for becoming a game developer.

			<div class="contents">
				<strong class="title2">What I Learned</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned how to use asynchronous methods with threads in Java and the structure of multi-threading.</li>
<li>I learned how to implement computer programs with Java Swing.</li>
					</ul>

				<strong class="title1">Process</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>The professor provided a program for cutting images with multiple buttons during the ‘Object-Oriented Programming’ class in the 2nd semester of the sophomore year. After mixing the button layout, click the button to show the picture.</li>
<li>When two buttons are clicked, I had the picture left as it is if the picture is the same. And, I had the picture hidden again after 0.5 seconds if the picture is different. In this case, I used the sleep function provided by Java Thread.</li>
<li>The number of clicks is counted each time the button is clicked. I implemented this function using the method of adding 1 to a variable.</li>
<li>I had a window stating 'Good job!' and the number of clicks displayed when all the same pictures are found.</li>
<li>Finally, I implemented the game start screen.</li>
<li>In this way, I was able to implement the program I wanted.</li>
