				<strong class="title1">Process to have Strengthened Abilities</strong><br>
				I am very ingenious and sometimes do weird things. As the most representative example, in order to efficiently check the temperature at the community center, I made my own thermal checker and strengthened my problem-solving and product design capabilities. First, I sketched out the heat checker and drew a blueprint. Then, I started to implement it, by cutting a paper box with scissors and pasting it with tape to make a square column so that the thermometer can be opened. Then, this square pole was taped to the elongated tablet cradle and fixed. Then, I had to take a temperature measurement, so I put a thread on the tablet holder. Therefore, when the thread is pulled, pressure is applied to the temperature measurement button and the button is pressed, allowing temperature measurement. Then, the thermometer was stretched upwards, and the phrase ‘Please put your forehead on it’ was attached to the thermometer. This is because complaints can be seen and understood and can be easily checked for fever. After going through this process, I was able to implement my own heat checker to do the heat check work more efficiently.
