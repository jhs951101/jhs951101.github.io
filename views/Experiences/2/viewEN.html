				This is to implement clean code and good code when developing programs.

				<strong class="title1">Process to have Strengthened Abilities</strong><br>
				At first, I just solved the problem on the algorithm site. However, there is a limit to studying with only the algorithm site, so I bought a book for coding test preparation. After I understood the example code in this book, I started memorizing it. After that, the application power was strengthened by solving the problem again on the algorithm site. After studying like this, I definitely felt that my algorithm design ability was strengthened. So now I am having more fun designing algorithms and solving more problems than ever before.

				<strong class="title2">Strengthened Abilities</strong><br>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Implementability, problem-solving ability</strong> : It has been strengthened through the process of implementing the algorithm as code.</li>
<li><strong>Patience, concentration</strong> : It has been strengthened through the process of trying after thinking about how to solve the error.</li>
<li><strong>Inquiry</strong>: It was strengthened through the process of designing an algorithm after thinking about how to solve a problem.</li>
					</ul>

						<li>I used several sites such as LeetCode, Programmers, Baekjoon, and Codeforces, but mainly the LeetCode site solved the problem.</li>
